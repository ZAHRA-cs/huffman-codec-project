HUFFMAN CODING TEST FILE
========================

This is a sample text file designed to test the Huffman encoding and decoding algorithm.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
This sentence contains every letter of the alphabet and is repeated to create patterns.

REPEATED CHARACTERS FOR TESTING:
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
cccccccccccccccccc

NUMBERS:
1234567890 1234567890 1234567890

SPECIAL CHARACTERS:
!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;':",./<>?

MIXED CONTENT:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
The compression ratio depends on character frequency distribution.
The compression ratio depends on character frequency distribution.

UNICODE CHARACTERS (if supported):
Hello World! 你好世界! مرحبا بالعالم!

DATA FOR FREQUENCY ANALYSIS:
The letter 'e' appears most frequently in English text.
The letter 'e' appears most frequently in English text.
The letter 'e' appears most frequently in English text.

PROGRAMMING CODE SNIPPET:
function huffmanEncode(text) {
    const frequencies = calculateFrequencies(text);
    const tree = buildHuffmanTree(frequencies);
    const codes = generateCodes(tree);
    return encodeText(text, codes);
}

MATHEMATICAL FORMULAS:
E = mc²
a² + b² = c²
F = ma

This file contains approximately 1500 characters and should compress well with Huffman coding
due to the repeated patterns and common character distributions in English text.

END OF TEST FILE
================

Additional notes:
- The .bin file will look like garbage in text editors (THIS IS CORRECT!)
- Use the decoder to verify successful compression
- SHA-256 hash ensures data integrity
- Compression ratio typically 40-60% for English text
